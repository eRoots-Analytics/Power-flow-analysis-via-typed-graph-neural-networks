I am currently modifying and refactoring this repo, so there are many things that won't work perfectly. <br />

This repo provides some code for:
* Building and training a typed graph neural network based power flow solver.
* Reloading a previous model and testing it.

*If you have any questions or observations, you can contact me at 782726@unizar.es*
